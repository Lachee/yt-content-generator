Oh yeah you will need some keys and stuff. Mostly a google client_secrets.json you get from an oAuth2 credential, and a .env with teh following:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` API key to access the voice services
- `PEXELS_KEY` API key to https://www.pexels.com/ to download stock videos
- `GOOGLE_CREDENTIAL_PATH` path to the aformentioned `client_secrets.json`
